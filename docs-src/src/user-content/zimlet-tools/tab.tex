\section{Drive App Tab}

The main option to interact with Drive is clicking on the Drive tab.
This click can have two different behaviours: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{everything is fine and the main view(Figure //ref) will be opened}
\item{cannot communicate with drive and an error view(Figure //ref) will be opened}
\end{itemize}

A request with the current zimbra user credentials is sent to drive and his own drive space is shown:
the drive view is composed by the left side with the complete tree of the folders 
and the content of the current folder which is set to root at the first access.\\
// figure Drive
\\

When the error view is shown(Figure //ref), it means that it's impossible for zimbra to communicate with the drive and
only a sysadmin can fix the server configuration.\\
// figure Error
\\
