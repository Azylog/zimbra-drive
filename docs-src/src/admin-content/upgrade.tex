\chapter{Upgrade}\label{==cha:upgrade==}
This chapter will guide the administrator through the manual upgrade of Zimbra Drive.
It's important to pay attention to the version of each component: the compatibility is granted 
only if each component has the same version.\\ 
Unlike zimlet and extension that can be upgraded with Zimbra upgrade, Zimbra Drive App must be kept manually updated.
