\chapter{Upgrade}\label{cha:upgrade}
This chapter will guide the administrator through the manual upgrade of Zimbra Drive.
It's important to pay attention to the version of each component: the compatibility is granted 
only if each component has the same version.\\ 
Unlike zimlet and extension that automatically upgrade, Zimbra Drive App must be kept manually updated.
