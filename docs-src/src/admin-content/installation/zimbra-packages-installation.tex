\section{Zimbra packages installation}

\begin{warning}
    The Zimbra Drive Zimlet and Extension are already installed in the default Zimbra installation
    starting from Zimbra 8.7.6.
\end{warning}
In this section is described how to manually install the Zimbra Drive Extension and the Zimbra Drive Zimlet.
    \subsection{Extension}
    First of all copy the file zimbradrive-extension.jar and zal.jar in the right place;
    then a mailbox restart is required to load the extension.
    \begin{verbatim}
    # As root
    mkdir -p /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive
    cp zimbradrive-extension.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/
    cp zal.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/
    # As zimbra
    mailboxdctl restart
    \end{verbatim}
    Everything is successfully done if extension start correctly. In order to verify it check in the mailbox.log;
    for example the following command must match with the last mailbox restart:
    \begin{verbatim}
    str="Initialized extension Zimbra Abstraction Layer for: zimbradrive";
    grep "${str}" /opt/zimbra/log/mailbox.log | tail -n 1;
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsection{Zimlet}
    Deploy the zimlet with the following command:
    \begin{verbatim}
    # As zimbra
    zmzimletctl deploy /tmp/openchat/com_zextras_chat_open.zip
    \end{verbatim}
    By default the zimlet is enabled for the `default` COS.
    Enable the zimlet on the required COSes from the administration console.
