\section{Zimbra packages installation}

\begin{warning}
The Zimbra Drive Extension and Zimlet are already installed in the default Zimbra installation
starting from Zimbra 8.7.6. However Zimbra Drive Extension requires the configuration of the domain attribute zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL.
\end{warning}
In this section is described how to manually install the Zimbra Drive Extension and the Zimbra Drive Zimlet.
\subsection{Extension}
    The files zimbradrive-extension.jar and zal.jar must be copied in the right place;
    then a mailbox restart is required to load the extension.
    \begin{verbatim}
# As root
mkdir -p /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive
cp zimbradrive-extension.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/
cp zal.jar /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/

# As zimbra
mailboxdctl restart
    \end{verbatim}
    Everything is successfully done if extension start correctly and it can be verified in mailbox.log.
    For example the following command must match with the last mailbox restart:
    \begin{verbatim}
str="Initialized extension Zimbra Abstraction Layer for: zimbradrive";
grep "${str}" /opt/zimbra/log/mailbox.log | tail -n 1;
    \end{verbatim}

    At last, the domain attribute zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL must be configured with the cloud url.

    \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
zmprov md domainExample.com zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL "https://cloudUrl"
    \end{verbatim}

\subsection{Zimlet}
    Deploy the zimlet with the following command:
    \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl deploy /tmp/openchat/com_zextras_drive_open.zip
    \end{verbatim}
    By default the zimlet is enabled for the `default` COS.
    Enable the zimlet on the required COSes from the administration console.
