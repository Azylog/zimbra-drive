\section{Overview}
\subsection{General architecture}\label{subsec:general architecture}
    The purpouse of Zimbra Drive is to connect the Zimbra end user to a cloud service, external to Zimbra;
    any Zimbra domain can be paired to a cloud service, then each Zimbra end user, belonging to this domain,
    will benefit to the same cloud service platform.

    Zimbra Drive is a three parts software (Zimbra Extension, Zimlet and Cloud App),
    that integrate an external storage services in the Zimbra Web Interface as well as authentication mechanism.
    Each Zimbra account will be linked to the external storage service account allowing the user back-and-forth.

\subsection{Components}
    Zimbra Drive components are the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Zimbra Extension
        \item Zimlet
        \item Cloud App
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{warning}
        Each component does not work without the others and without a careful configuration.
        However any error in installation and configuration won't affect Zimbra usability.
    \end{warning}

        \subsection{Extension}
        The Zimbra Drive extension is installed in the mailboxd component, it acts in the middle between the Zimbra

        \subsection{Zimlet}
        The Zimbra Drive zimlet improves the user Zimbra interface adding a new tab before Preferences tab,
        this tab is titled "Drive". Furthermore the zimlet let user perform search in linked cloud.\\
        The zimlet component is contained in package com\_zextras\_drive\_open.zip and the zimlet name is precisely
        "com\_zextras\_drive\_open".

        \subsection{Cloud App}\label{subsec:supportedClouds}
        The external services of cloud storage need specific app with dedicated API to communicate with Zimbra Drive Extension;
        Zimbra Drive provides an app to each service supported.

        \subsubsection{Nextcloud/ownCloud}
        The Nextcloud/ownCloud App is a specific application for Nextcloud and ownCloud, it provide transparent authentication in
        ownCloud and Nextcloud using Zimbra credentials and a layer of compatibility which abstracts the version of
        ownCloud and Nextcloud for the extension.
