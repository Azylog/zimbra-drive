\section{Zimbra Extension and Zimlet upgrade}

When Zimbra is upgraded to a more recent version, Zimbra Drive can be installed right from the installation.
Anyway Zimbra Drive can be kept upgraded in the same Zimbra major.minor versions with apt-get or yum:

\begin{verbatim}
# As root, when apt-get is available
apt-get update; apt-get install zimbra-drive
# As root, when yum is available
yum update; yum install zimbra-drive
\end{verbatim}
