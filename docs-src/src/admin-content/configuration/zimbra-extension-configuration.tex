\section{Zimbra Extension configuration}

    Zimbra Extension setup requires the url of the cloud service that will be paired.//
    This url has to be set in the domain attribute zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL and 
    it is common to all users belonging the same domain.
    Different domains may have different cloud service urls.\\
    The command is the following:
    \begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
zmprov md domainExample.com zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL CLOUD_URL
    \end{verbatim}

    The cloud service url (\texttt{CLOUD\_URL}) has to be in the form: \texttt{protocol://cloudHost/path}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{\texttt{protocol}: can be \texttt{http} or \texttt{https}}
        \item{\texttt{cloudHost}: hostname of the server where the cloud service lies}
        \item{\texttt{path}: path in server of the targeted cloud service}
    \end{itemize}

    Moreover each cloud service have its entry point.\\
