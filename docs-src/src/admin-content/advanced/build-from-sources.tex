\section{Build from sources}
This section exposes the steps to build the Zimbra Drive components.
The official Zimbra Drive source repository is hosted on \href{https://github.com/ZeXtras/ZimbraDrive}{GitHub.com/ZeXtras/ZimbraDrive}.

The build system uses relative path; the following example assumes that the working path is /tmp/
but it can be changed at will.
\begin{verbatim}
# Clean the folder that will be used for the build
rm -rf /tmp/ZimbraDrive && cd /tmp/

# Clone the source repository
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ZeXtras/ZimbraDrive.git

# Jump into the source folder
cd ZimbraDrive

# Checkout the correct branch for the Zimbra release (assuming Zimbra 8.8.0 )
git checkout release/8.8.0

# Build the whole package (can take some minutes)
make
\end{verbatim}

The final artifact \texttt{zimbra\_drive.tgz} will be placed in folder \texttt{/tmp/zimbradrive/dist}.

The \texttt{dist} folder:
    \dirtree{%
    .1 /tmp/zimbradrive/dist.
        .2 zimbra-drive.md5.
        .2 zimbra\_drive.tgz.
   }

The archive zimbra\_drive.tgz contains all components of Zimbra Drive:
\dirtree{%
.1 zimbra\_drive.tgz.
    .2 zimbra-extension.
        .3 zimbradrive-extension.jar.
        .3 zal.jar.
        .3 zimbradrive-extension.conf.example.
    .2 zimlet.
        .3 com\_zextras\_drive\_open.zip.
    .2 Nextcloud-app.
        .3 zimbradrive.tar.gz.
    .2 LICENSE.
    .2 README.md.
