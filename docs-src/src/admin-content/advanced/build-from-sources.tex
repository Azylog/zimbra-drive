\section{Build from sources}
This section will guide the administrator through the steps to build the Zimbra Drive components.
The official Zimbra Drive source repository is hosted on GitHub.com/ZeXtras/ZimbraDrive.

The build system uses relative path; the following example assumes that the working path is /tmp/
but it can be changed at will.
\begin{verbatim}
# Clean the folder that will be used for the build
rm -rf /tmp/ZimbraDrive && cd /tmp/

# Clone the source repository
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ZeXtras/ZimbraDrive.git

# Jump into the source folder
cd ZimbraDrive

# Checkout the correct branch for the Zimbra release (assuming Zimbra 8.7.6 )
git checkout release/8.7.6

# Build the whole package or single component (can take some minutes)
make
# or for example
make zimbra-extension/
\end{verbatim}

The final artifacts will be placed in folder \texttt{/tmp/zimbradrive/dist} and \texttt{/tmp/zimbradrive/build}.
The whole package is located in \texttt{dist} which is made by single components located in \texttt{build}.\\
The \texttt{dist} folder:
    \dirtree{%
    .1 /tmp/zimbradrive/dist.
        .2 zimbra-drive.md5.
        .2 zimbra\_drive.tgz.
   }

The \texttt{build} folder:
    \dirtree{%
    .1 /tmp/zimbradrive/build.
        .2 zimbra-extension.
            .3 zimbradrive-extension.jar.
            .3 zal.jar.
            .3 zimbradrive-extension.conf.example.
        .2 zimlet.
            .3 com\_zextras\_drive\_open.zip.
        .2 Nextcloud-app.
            .3 zimbradrive.tar.gz.
        .2 LICENSE.
        .2 README.md.
   }
