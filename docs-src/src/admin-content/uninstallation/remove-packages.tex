The uninstallation process of Zimbra Drive Zimlet and Zimbra Drive Extension requires just to undeploy zimlet and clean extension folder from zimbra;
no more data is stored.\\ \\
Remove Zimbra Drive zimlet:
\begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl undeploy com_zextras_drive_open
\end{verbatim}
Remove Zimbra Drive Extension:
\begin{verbatim}
# As root
rm -rf /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/

# As zimbra
zmmailboxdctl restart
\end{verbatim}
The last but not necessary step is to clean the domain attribute with the command\\
\texttt{zmprov md domainExample.com zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL ""}
