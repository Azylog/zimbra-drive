\section{Remove Cloud app}
\subsection{NextCloud/OwnCloud}\label{subsec:nextcloudOwncloudUninstallation}
    In NextCloud/OwnCloud platform, the Zimbra Drive App can be removed from the Nextcloud/Owncloud Admin Interface:
    it must be disabled from the "Enabled Apps" tab and then uninstalled from the "Disabled Apps".
    
    With the previous steps, the Zimbra Drive App folder ( \texttt{PATH\textunderscore TO\textunderscore CLOUD/apps/zimbradrive})
    is deleted but all the users files still remains in the cloud service drive.//
    NextCloud/Owncloud can be completely cleaned up with the following commands:

    \begin{verbatim}
###
SQL > SELECT * FROM oc_zimbradrive_users;
for (user in previous output) {add user; delete user;}
###
    \end{verbatim}
