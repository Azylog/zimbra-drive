\chapter{Configuration}\label{cha:configuration}

Zimbra Drive configuration is splitted in Zimbra side and Cloud side.
Zimbra Drive Zimlet doesn't need more than standard zimlet configuration,
therefore Zimbra side requires only Zimbra Drive Extension configuration.\\
About Cloud side, each supported cloud service configuration will be shown later;
they are indipendents and only the configuration according to own cloud service is required.
